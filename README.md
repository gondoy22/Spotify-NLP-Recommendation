# Spotify-NLP-Recommendation
The goal of this project is to create a script that accepts a phrase from a user and returns custom made Spotify playlist. The songs will be suggested based on metrics provided by the Spotify API, and an NLP model will be trained on song lyrics to enhance the recommendations. For a model that translates lyrics to Spotify metrics, we fine-tuned BERT to perform this task. Below, you will find folders such as 'data,' where we have saved data in CSV format, containing almost 10k songs with lyrics. The lyrics were fetched using the GENIUS API, and the code for this process is also included in the 'data' folder
